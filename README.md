# Assignment-5
As with previous assignments, assume that you're working for Princeton's Registrar's Office. You're given a database containing data about classes and courses offered during an upcoming Princeton semester. Your task is to create a Python application that allows Princeton students and other interested parties to query the database. More specifically, your task is to redesign your Assignment 2 application such that (1) its server is efficient by using multiple processes, and (2) its client refreshes its output with each input keystroke, and does so responsively by using multiple threads.
