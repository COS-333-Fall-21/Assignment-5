What Adam Ziff contributed to this Assignment:
I implemented the consume_cpu_time function in regserver.py
with the delay command-line argument so we could simulate
a slow or unresponsive server. I then changed regserver.py
to use multiple processes, forking a new process for each
request to speed them up. I then removed the submit button
and pair programmed with Alex for parts 5 and 6 (he typed),
changing the requests to the server to trigger on text input
rather than the submit button and implementing threading
to use multiple processes for the separate requests. We
had one lingering bug with a 'ran out of input' error in
reg.py, and we worked together in several sessions to debug
it, ultimately solving it with Prof. Dondero's solution.
