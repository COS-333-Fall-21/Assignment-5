Assignment: 5

What Alex Baroody contributed to this Assignment:
I typed during the pair programming of reg.py.
Afterwards, I focused my time on making the GUI
and connecting to the server. I also parsed the arguments
for both reg.py and regserver.py, reading the documentation
in order to make sure that the points we lost last time
wouldn't be lost this time. Next, I went through the
assignment specs and made sure all of the errors were
handled. I also performed lots of the initial debugging,
while Adam and I worked together to do most of the testing.
Finally, I developed an intimate relationship with pylint
as I edited, checked, and edited the code again to conform
with pylint's standards. Specifically, I refactored a lot
of our code into helper methods and more distinct blocks,
as well as making lots of constants to avoid hard coding
numbers.

What Adam Ziff contributed to this Assignment:
I implemented the consume_cpu_time function in regserver.py
with the delay command-line argument so we could simulate 
a slow or unresponsive server. I then changed regserver.py
to use multiple processes, forking a new process for each 
request to speed them up. I then removed the submit button
and pair programmed with Alex for parts 5 and 6 (he typed),
changing the requests to the server to trigger on text input
rather than the submit button and implementing threading
to use multiple processes for the separate requests. We 
had one lingering bug with a 'ran out of input' error in 
reg.py, and we worked together in several sessions to debug
it, ultimately solving it with Prof. Dondero's solution.

Assignment Assessment:
This assignment was fun! The GUI is much nicer than the
command line; however, it's more challenging to test.
There were a lot more corner cases/exceptions this time,
and having to rewrite one of our queries took a long time.

Time Spent:
12 hours total
8 hours of pair programming
4 hours each of individual programming
