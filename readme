Assignment: 5

What Alex Baroody contributed to this Assignment:
I started by diagnosing and fixing our errors from assignment 2. This included keeping the application running when we ran
into errors, as well as selecting the first line of the list
widget on application load. Lastly, I fixed how we built the
list widget such that we could build a blank widget if any
errors occured. Once I finished with our problems from
assignment 2, I moved on to pair programming for parts 5 and
6 (I typed). This meant adding in worker threads to the client
such that each request spawned a new thread, reducing front
end lag. Next, I refactored our code to more closely resemble
the code from lecture: the structure of our code from assignment
2 was iffy at best, and the code from lecture provided a good
template. Lastly, I worked with Adam to solve our 'ran out of
input' error, which included lots of fruitless googling, a
trip to office hours, and eventually a successful email to
Prof. Dondero, who fixed it immediately.

What Adam Ziff contributed to this Assignment:
I implemented the consume_cpu_time function in regserver.py
with the delay command-line argument so we could simulate
a slow or unresponsive server. I then changed regserver.py
to use multiple processes, forking a new process for each
request to speed them up. I then removed the submit button
and pair programmed with Alex for parts 5 and 6 (he typed),
changing the requests to the server to trigger on text input
rather than the submit button and implementing threading
to use multiple processes for the separate requests. We
had one lingering bug with a 'ran out of input' error in
reg.py, and we worked together in several sessions to debug
it, ultimately solving it with Prof. Dondero's solution.

Assignment Assessment:
This assignment was certainly less work than previous
assignments. It was fun to see our app getting easier and
easier to use as we progressed, going from unsuable around
step 2 to very useable around step 6. We appreciated the
fact that we didn't have to put in as much effort, as the
work of our project is ramping up.

Time Spent:
