Assignment: 2

What Alex Baroody contributed to this Assignment:
I typed during the pair programming of reg.py.
Afterwards, I focused my time on making the GUI
and connecting to the server. I also parsed the arguments
for both reg.py and regserver.py, reading the documentation
in order to make sure that the points we lost last time
wouldn't be lost this time. Next, I went through the
assignment specs and made sure all of the errors were
handled. I also performed lots of the initial debugging,
while Adam and I worked together to do most of the testing.
Finally, I developed an intimate relationship with pylint
as I edited, checked, and edited the code again to conform
with pylint's standards. Specifically, I refactored a lot
of our code into helper methods and more distinct blocks,
as well as making lots of constants to avoid hard coding
numbers.

What Adam Ziff contributed to this Assignment:
I did the initial creation and setup for reserver.py,
bringing over the relevant code from Assignment 1. I pair
programmed with Alex for setting up the GUI in reg.py. I
also wrote our get_detail() database query in reserver.py
to match the style detailed in Prof. Donderoâ€™s Ed post,
turning it from one big query into multiple smaller queries
and returning a cleaner array of only the data we need
instead of a massive array of tuples with each db row. I
helped debug and test both programs, running the reference
programs while Alex ran our programs and pointed out several
key distinctions including the need to sort Professors and
Crosslistings.

Assignment Assessment:
This assignment was fun! The GUI is much nicer than the
command line; however, it's more challenging to test.
There were a lot more corner cases/exceptions this time,
and having to rewrite one of our queries took a long time.

Time Spent:
12 hours total
8 hours of pair programming
4 hours each of individual programming
